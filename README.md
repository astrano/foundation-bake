A simple boilerplate frontend app made possible by [Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman) and the [foundation-five generator](https://www.npmjs.org/package/generator-foundation-five).  It creates a default [Foundation Five](http://foundation.zurb.com/) site that can be started with an `npm install`, `bower install` and finally `grunt serve`.  The main difference between this and running your own foundation-five generator in Yeoman is I added [grunt-bake](https://github.com/MathiasPaumgarten/grunt-bake) to the build, which will let me separate out common elements and leverage grunt-bake's templates.
